- [**Serena**](https://github.com/oraios/serena)
  - Serena is a powerful coding agent toolkit capable of turning an LLM into a fully-featured agent that works directly on your codebase. Unlike most other tools, it is not tied to an LLM, framework or an interface, making it easy to use it in a variety of ways.
  - Serena provides essential semantic code retrieval and editing tools that are akin to an IDE's capabilities, extracting code entities at the symbol level and exploiting relational structure. When combined with an existing coding agent, these tools greatly enhance (token) efficiency.
- [**Context7**](https://github.com/upstash/context7)
  - Up-to-date Docs for LLMs and AI code editors. Get the latest documentation and code into Cursor, Claude, or other LLMs
  - Context7 MCP pulls up-to-date, version-specific documentation and code examples straight from the source — and places them directly into your prompt.
- Microsoft Docs
  - Give your AI assistant (Claude, Cursor, Copilot, Codex, ...) direct access to the latest official Microsoft documentation.
