# Commands

## Quick save command

> Create a `/quicksave` command to be run just before ending a Claude Code session. The command should do a `git command` and `git tag` on the project, using the current date and time for the tag formatted as `yyyyMMdd_HHmm`, e.g. `20260221_2013`. It should also write a note of what was completed during the session, and a not of what the next task to work on is, to a file called `DEVLOG.md`.

## AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md

> The role of this file is to describe common mistakes and confusion points that agents might encounter as they work in this project. If you ever encounter something in the project that surprises you, please alert the developer working with you and indicate that this is the case in the AGENTS.md file to help prevent future agents from having the same issue.
